Computer science (CS) assistant professor and researcher. In my early studies (high school), the idea of being a computer engineer never occurred to me. I was aiming to pursue my university studies in pharmaceutical studies. For that, I am grateful I didn't obtain a great mark when graduating to pursue my dream. So, I chose translation as the first discipline, journalism, then common core: exact science, technology and IT. I got the third choice. I got my engineer diploma in computer science from Abdelhak Benhamouda university, Jijel, Algeria. After that, I continued my studies in Higher school of computer science (ESI), Algiers, Algeria.

My research is about automatic text summarization (ATS), a field which first appeared back in 1958 at IBM labs. I always was fascinated by science fiction movies (and still), especially the idea of intelligent machines. I find Artificial intelligent (AI) as an amazing field, the best among others of CS. So, I worked on image processing during my final project in Jijel university. Then when I joined ESI, I found an interesting field which is natural language processing (NLP). It was a so challenging field and I like that. On top of that, I'm interested on knowledge representation (KR) and reasoning.

I am an open source software (OSS) enthusiast. Since 2012, I decided to use just open source just to prove to myself I'm not dependent. I started by installing Linux Mint distribution with KDE desktop (which I'm still using). The hard part was to let go of Ms office which is a good piece of software, and its alternatives wasn't as good as they are now. So, I learned LaTeX and now I'm dependent on it. I thought about it: if I use software gratis, I have to give something back. This is when I decided to put my research project (AllSummarizer) on Github. Since then, I started some non-popular projects just to have fun.
