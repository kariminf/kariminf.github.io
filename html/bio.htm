Computer science (CS) assistant professor and researcher at Ecole nationale sup√©rieure d'informatique (Higher school of computer science).
My research is about automatic text summarization (ATS), a field which first appeared back in 1958 at IBM labs.
I was always fascinated by the idea of intelligent machines.
I find Artificial Intelligent (AI) an amazing field, the best among others of CS.
So, I worked on image processing during my final project at Jijel university.
Then when I joined ESI, I found a more interesting and challenging field which is natural language processing (NLP).
On top of that, I'm interested on knowledge representation (KR) and reasoning.

Mostly, I do it for fun.
