my dissertation was: proposition of a multi-agents architecture for Arabic handwriting detection.
From a dataset of images which contains Arabic handwriting, the system has to process them and detect the text.
An OCR for handwritten Arabic. I got to do all the processing till segmentation, but unfortunately not the recognition part.
